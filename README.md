Radix
=====

A trie/radix tree/prefix tree implementation in Go.

This project was written mainly for me to teach myself Go, so it's not really meant to be production-ready.

This is based on [an implementation in Swift by Steven Scally](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club/tree/master/Radix%20Tree).
The code is largely just translated from Swift into Go, although I've changed some of the semantics.
